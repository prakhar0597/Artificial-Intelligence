# CSCI-561-Artificial-Intelligence

These programming assignments were done as part of CSCI 561 Foundations of Artifical Intelligence at USC offered by Prof. Laurent Itti in the Fall of 2019 at University of Southern California. All of the programming assignments were implemented using Java.

### Assignment 1:
Assignment 1 is based on the implementation of global search strategies including uninformed search strategies such as Breadth-First Search(BFS), Uniform Cost Search(UCS) and informed search strategies such as AStar heuristic search.            

### Assignment 2:
Assignment 2 was based on adversarial search. A game playing agent was developed using Minimax and Alpha-beta pruning to find the next optimal move for a player in the game of Halma.            

### Assignment 3:
Assignment 3 was based on inference in First-Order Logic. Designed an automated system in Java to alert user about potential risks of taking drug based upon userâ€™s medical history. Conducted First Order Logic Resolution in knowledge base to entail results.
- Involved lexical parsing of logical statement and converting each statement into CNF form. This was done with just the native libraries.
- Apply unification algorithm to among clauses of the Knowledge base to resolve the clauses to determine entailment
